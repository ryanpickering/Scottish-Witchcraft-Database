                <h2>Daemonologie and Newes from Scotland</h2>
                <div align="left">
                <p>Daemonologie was written in 1597 by King James VI of Scotland and I of England as a treatise on the existence of witches in the world. This treatise was instrumental in the growth of Scottish witchcraft prosecution and thus must be analyzed in order to have any understanding of the Scottish Witchcraft database. It was partly inspired by James’ involvement in the trial of the North Berwick witches, who were eventually condemned for treasonous activities of trying to kill the king for the devil. As the witches said in court that the devil thought the king was the greatest enemy he had on Earth, James made it his lifelong duty, as a soldier of Christ, to fight witches and lead his nation against Satan (Tyson, 3-4). The treatise eventually led, when James was crowned king of England as James I, to the new 1604 act regarding witchcraft, which abolished Elizabeth’s 1563 act and placed much harsher punishments on the practice of witchcraft. Just attempting to cause harm using witchcraft, which was punishable by one year of imprisonment under the Elizabethan law, was now punishable by hanging. Any form of preparing or attempting to invoke witchcraft was made a felony punishable by hanging, including offences to property and livestock. It is the purpose of this distance reading and analysis to discover if there is indeed a connection between the witchcraft laid out in Daemonologie and the actual prosecution and persecution of those deemed witches in this period. </p>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>First, we will turn to a brief close reading and summary of Daemonologie. The treatise is made up of three separate books in the form of a dialogue, each dealing with a different aspect of witchcraft. The dialogue is between two friends, Philomathes and Epistemon, the latter ostensibly representing King James himself. </p>
                <p>The first book deals with the existence of witchcraft and how it operates in the world between a witch and the devil. The dialogue discusses the differences between witches who practice sorcery and magicians who practice necromancers, based on both common misconceptions and their level of learning. Conversation moves towards a discussion of “white magic’s” existence and how it is just as bad as harmful magic because it still contravenes the teachings of the Bible. Necromancy, on the other hand, may be studied by learned men but its practice is unlawful as well, because to be a master of necromancy is to be commanded by the devil himself. The two then discuss what is constituted in a pact with the devil, alongside what the nature of fallen angels is. Epistemon holds that certain ideas about fallen angels being elemental are false because angels fell not according to weight but by their nature, and God would not permit their hierarchy to be known by humans. The book concludes by stating that magicians too should be condemned for practicing magic just as witches are, refuting ideas that they are good and that Moses was one under God. </p>
                <p>The second book moves to a discussion of the practices of witches. Philomathes raises three initial objections to the existence of witches, and Epistenom refutes them each in turn. First, in response to the assertion that the Bible only refers to magic in the context of magicians and not witches, “Epistemon agrees that many referred to in the Bible who used magic were necromancers and magicians, but asserts that others were witches, according to the vulgar definition of a witch being one controlled or ruled by the Devil” (Tyson 31). The second reason Philomathes gives is that witches do not actually have the power of the devil but are just afflicted with mental illness and melancholy. Epistemon argues that witches do not exhibit the typical symptons of melancholy as understood at that time. Finally, to the assertion that if witches did exist, mankind would fall to their power, Epistemon says that the power of the devil is limited by God himself, so witches therefore are also limited. Epistemon moves on to explain his definition of sorcery, along with different classifications of reasoning and practices. These are detailed and varied, often drawing upon the Scriptures but also on King James’ own beliefs and experiences regarding witchcraft. </p>
                <p>The final third book deals with the four types of spirits that exist and that may be employed by a witch. These four types are spirits that haunt houses and places, which have diverse names and may enter a house through the body of a dead person; spirits that haunt and follow people, which are some of the worst possible spirits to encounter; incubi and succubi, found in northern Scottish provinces more often due to lax moral standing, and are essentially sex spirits that possess the body of a person and cause problems for them; and fairies, which Epistemon asserts do not actually exist but are delusions of the devil or Catholic superstition. They then briefly discuss the proper methods of punishing a witch, and execution by fire is considered the best way to go about it. Also, legal practice regarding the prosecution of witches is discussed, with suggestions of caution to judges, methods of discovering objective proof of witchcraft in the form of marks, and the legitimacy of witches testifying against other witches. </p>
