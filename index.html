            <h2>Introduction</h2>
           <div align="left">
                <p><i>Note: this website works best in Google Chrome on a desktop or laptop computer. Other browsers and mediums may experience some formatting issues, though hopefully not to an unreadable degree.</i></p>
                <p>This analysis is intended to discover if there are any continuities or differences between the theory and the practice of witchcraft in Scotland under the 1604 Witchcraft Act. King James VI's Daemonologie, initially published in 1597 in response to the North Berwick witch trials and James' personal involvement in them, reflects a very specific understanding of witchcraft derived from a Protestant worldview that eventually became law in 1604 with the unification of England and Scotland under James, now known as King James I. Utilizing the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft, hosted by the University of Edinburgh, which covers witchcraft cases from 1563 to 1736, I intend to inquire whether or not certain elements of King James' beliefs about witches were fully carried out through practice in the country.</p>
                <p>This analysis will primarily draw upon King James' understanding of witchcraft, even though his Witchcraft Act only came into effect some 40 years after the start of the database in 1563. That time period was governed by the Scottish Witchcraft Act of 1563, which was stronger than the English policy at the time but still slightly less stringent than this new 1604 Act. Thus, I believe it is acceptable to primarily pull our understanding of witchcraft at the highest levels of government from James' 1597 treatise, since his work is the most effective at conveying a learned opinion of witchcraft in this area and general time period.</p> 
                <p>This work will be done, not through a typical close reading of the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft, hosted by the University of Edinburgh, but through a more quantitative, distance analysis of the information inside the database. Done alongside this is a short quantitative analysis of Daemonologie that confirms by nature of network visualization and corpus analysis King James' arguments: that is to say, a quantitative, numbers-based reading of his treatise supports his overarching arguments regarding witchcraft. </p>
                <p>Before all of this, the methodology of this project will be laid out in full, detailing each digital tool that will be used and for what purpose. Programs such as Voyant Tools and Google Fusion Tables have been utilized to make the material clearer in a quantitative sense.</p>
                <p>This kind of inquiry is important to undertake because it can challenge assumptions about subject material, sometimes in surprising ways. By taking a distance reading of both Daemonologie and the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft, I believe we will be able to better understand both mediums when pairing them with respective close readings.</p>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <div align="left">
                    <p>It is important in any digital undertaking to outline the methodology of the piece before delving too deep into the material. Thus, this methodology section is presented to better familiarize the reader with the tools being used through this piece. MDB Viewer, Voyant Tools, and Google Fusion Tables have been used throughout this piece for different reasons.</p>
                    <h3>MDB Viewer</h3>
                    <p>MDB Viewer is the simplest of the tools used in this project. As will be discussed later, the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft is housed in an old file format Word programs cannot easily work with. The .MDB file format houses different tables in a hierarchical framework that can be interpreted by a website, such as the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft. This software removes that framework, which only serves an organizational purpose, and allows me to access the raw data inside. Thus, I was forced to use this free software to both view the material housed in the .MDB format and to export certain tables for analysis within Google Fusion Tables. Unfortunately, as freeware, this program could only export as .CSVs half of the rows within respective tables, thus imposing a limit on the depth of some analysis. I regret that this is the case, but with the limitations of the initial file format, this is a limit I have had to work within.</p>
                    <h3>Voyant Tools</h3>
                    <p>Voyant Tools is a corpus analysis tool most useful for looking at larger documents or sets of documents to visualize and analyze patterns and trends in those documents. It is free to use and hosted online, where one simply has to upload their plain text documents or paste text into the website. With that done, a multitude of different options are presented to a user: they can visualize the text in wordclouds or different graphs, edit exclusion lists to focus in more clearly on what is useful to them, and create network visualizations that track connections between words and phrases. I utilized this program specifically to take a look at Daemonologie, which is quite a large document. Word clouds and network visualization are both used for the corpus in order to compare a close reading understanding of the piece to a distance read, to see if there are differences and similarities with what we can find out.</p>
                    <h3>Google Fusion Tables</h3>
                    <p>Google Fusion Tables is "an experimental data visualization web application to gather, visualize, and share data tables" ("About Fusion Tables"). I used this application to better engage with my material outside of the MDB Viewer. It allowed me to gather statistics such as word counts regarding different elements of witchcraft, such as the diversity of different charges levied against accused witches alongside witchcraft. It also allowed me to automatically geocode locations found in the charts to create maps that show different parishes of Scotland in different contexts. Google Fusion Tables has been essential to this work and has illuminated interesting trends throughout this project.</p>
                    <h3>Github / Twitter Bootstrap / Start Bootstrap</h3>
                    <p>These three platforms are how I built this website which houses this material so aesthetically. Github, normally a code repository for programmers, has become a haven for digital historians and has the framework to host files and a website quite easily with a free account. It also allows open note taking, which I did not need to use for this project but have utilized in past projects to great success. Twitter Bootstrap is the CSS and HTML framework in which I have coded this website, and the initial template, now altered to fit my aesthetic specifications, was from Start Bootstrap. These three platforms, while not having a direct effect on the actual substance of this project, have been absolutely essential for presenting this project in the way I had imagined.</p>

                <h2>Daemonologie and the 1604 Witchcraft Act</h2>
                <div align="left">
                <h3>Daemonologie</h3>
                <p>Daemonologie was written in 1597 by King James VI of Scotland and I of England as a treatise on the existence of witches in the world. This treatise was instrumental in the growth of Scottish witchcraft prosecution and thus must be analyzed in order to have any understanding of the Scottish Witchcraft database. It was partly inspired by James’ involvement in the trial of the North Berwick witches, who were eventually condemned for treasonous activities of trying to kill the king for the devil. As the witches said in court that the devil thought the king was the greatest enemy he had on Earth, James made it his lifelong duty, as a soldier of Christ, to fight witches and lead his nation against Satan (Tyson, 3-4). The treatise eventually led, when James was crowned king of England as James I, to the new 1604 act regarding witchcraft, which abolished Elizabeth’s 1563 act and placed much harsher punishments on the practice of witchcraft. Just attempting to cause harm using witchcraft, which was punishable by one year of imprisonment under the Elizabethan law, was now punishable by hanging. Any form of preparing or attempting to invoke witchcraft was made a felony punishable by hanging, including offences to property and livestock. It is the purpose of this distance reading and analysis to discover if there is indeed a connection between the witchcraft laid out in Daemonologie and the actual prosecution and persecution of those deemed witches in this period. </p>
            <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>First, we will turn to a brief close reading and summary of Daemonologie. The treatise is made up of three separate books in the form of a dialogue, each dealing with a different aspect of witchcraft. The dialogue is between two friends, Philomathes and Epistemon, the latter ostensibly representing King James himself. </p>
                <p>The first book deals with the existence of witchcraft and how it operates in the world between a witch and the devil. The dialogue discusses the differences between witches who practice sorcery and magicians who practice necromancers, based on both common misconceptions and their level of learning. Conversation moves towards a discussion of “white magic’s” existence and how it is just as bad as harmful magic because it still contravenes the teachings of the Bible. Necromancy, on the other hand, may be studied by learned men but its practice is unlawful as well, because to be a master of necromancy is to be commanded by the devil himself. The two then discuss what is constituted in a pact with the devil, alongside what the nature of fallen angels is. Epistemon holds that certain ideas about fallen angels being elemental are false because angels fell not according to weight but by their nature, and God would not permit their hierarchy to be known by humans. The book concludes by stating that magicians too should be condemned for practicing magic just as witches are, refuting ideas that they are good and that Moses was one under God. </p>
                <p>The second book moves to a discussion of the practices of witches. Philomathes raises three initial objections to the existence of witches, and Epistenom refutes them each in turn. First, in response to the assertion that the Bible only refers to magic in the context of magicians and not witches, “Epistemon agrees that many referred to in the Bible who used magic were necromancers and magicians, but asserts that others were witches, according to the vulgar definition of a witch being one controlled or ruled by the Devil” (Tyson 31). This meshes with his assertion that women, being weaker than men inherently, are more prone to witchcraft. The second reason Philomathes gives is that witches do not actually have the power of the devil but are just afflicted with mental illness and melancholy. Epistemon argues that witches do not exhibit the typical symptons of melancholy as understood at that time. Finally, to the assertion that if witches did exist, mankind would fall to their power, Epistemon says that the power of the devil is limited by God himself, so witches therefore are also limited. Epistemon moves on to explain his definition of sorcery, along with different classifications of reasoning and practices. These are detailed and varied, often drawing upon the Scriptures but also on King James’ own beliefs and experiences regarding witchcraft. </p>
                <p>The final third book deals with the four types of spirits that exist and that may be employed by a witch. These four types are spirits that haunt houses and places, which have diverse names and may enter a house through the body of a dead person; spirits that haunt and follow people, which are some of the worst possible spirits to encounter; incubi and succubi, found in northern Scottish provinces more often due to lax moral standing, and are essentially sex spirits that possess the body of a person and cause problems for them; and fairies, which Epistemon asserts do not actually exist but are delusions of the devil or Catholic superstition. They then briefly discuss the proper methods of punishing a witch, and execution by fire is considered the best way to go about it. Also, legal practice regarding the prosecution of witches is discussed, with suggestions of caution to judges, methods of discovering objective proof of witchcraft in the form of marks, and the legitimacy of witches testifying against other witches. </p>
            <h4>Corpus Analysis</h4>
                <p>Initially, the modern English translation of all three books of Daemonologie were plugged into Voyant Tools’ basic text analyzer all as one file. Results from that were much more responsive than trying with the originally spelt version of the treatise, and findings were varied and somewhat surprising. Below is a wordcloud created from Daemonologie that, while not particularly useful in an academic setting, is still an effective visual tool for understanding the treatise at a quantitative level.</p> 
                <iframe style='width: 100%; height: 800px' src='http://voyant-tools.org:80/?stopList=keywords-7d360ab749d3f038025b9e44d09e6190&visible=25&view=Cirrus&corpus=f8577fad5ca3169ef64ae366e3f21950'></iframe><br><br>
                <p>The 6 most frequent terms in all three of the books were god (86), devil (50), spirits (48), things (39), spirit (37), and finally witches (36). It is surprising to see that witches was such a small number compared to other terms that one might expect to be secondary to them. Indeed, as the main point of this piece is to discuss the reality of witches, seeing them as much lower on the frequent word list is hard to understand. Witchcraft as a term, additionally, appeared 20 times in the corpus, adding to the number of references to the subject but still well below the number of times the term ‘god’ or terms relating to spirits appeared. The way King James discussed witchcraft fit with his Protestant worldview and conception of the actual power of witches. The language in his treatise reflects the assumption of witches being only allowed their limited power from God’s providence, and the same with the devil. By speaking about God and the devil more than actual witches, whom his treatise is ostensibly about, James reveals his deeply Protestant beliefs that can be discovered both on a close reading level and from a distance. We see an acknowledgement of the importance of God and the devil over individual witches both through qualitative understanding of the piece, and through a qualitative analysis of the corpus at large. I believe that this conclusion serves as initial evidence at the value of quantitative analysis of this kind of text. </p>
                <p>Additionally, visualization of links between terms in the corpus allow for further understanding of larger concepts in the treatise. Below is an interactive graph showing links between terms.</p> 
                <iframe style='width: 100%; height: 800px' src='http://voyant-tools.org:80/?mode=corpus&stopList=keywords-7d360ab749d3f038025b9e44d09e6190&view=CollocatesGraph&corpus=f8577fad5ca3169ef64ae366e3f21950'></iframe><br><br>
                <p>We can draw several interesting conclusions from this that support our already solid understanding of James’ treatise. We can see that the strongest connections on the graph emanate from the term ‘god;’ the two strongest connections are towards ‘law’ and ‘permits,’ with weaker connections towards ‘devil,’ ‘knows,’ and ‘horrible.’ This further solidifies our understanding that God is in full control of affairs: he creates the 'law' which is akin to God's Word, and he 'permits' certain things, such as the actions of the devil. All of this reinforces both God's omnipotence and Protestant ideas of providence and predestination in the fact that God knows and permits all he deigns to. Spirits are also central to this network graph, with connections branching out to several different words: 'kinds,' 'calls,' 'haunts,' 'houses,' and 'fourth.' All of this is in relation to the third book of Daemonologie, where King James through the character of Epistemon discusses the four classifications of spirits in relation to their actions on earth.</p>
            <h3>1604 Act</h3>
                <p>King James' treatise on witchcraft had an important impact on witchcraft legislation of the day due to the nature of his position. In 1604, after having taken the throne of both England and Scotland, he repealed Elizabeth's 1563 Witchcraft Act in favour of one much more severe and with a wider scope. His Act allowed for the execution of anyone who merely attempted to cause harm with witchcraft, rather than simply those who succeeded as was the case under Elizabeth. Punishment was still maintained for those who used witchcraft in reference to material goods, such as finding gold or silver, or destroying goods or cattle. Additionally, the invocation of spirits in itself was deemed a crime worthy of death. </p>
                <p>Before the ascent of King James to both thrones, Scotland had its own witchcraft legislation, also put forward in 1563. It forbade the practice of witchcraft as well and condemned both its practice and the consultation of witchcrafts as justification for death. King James' witchcraft act thus maintains this serious character that is a major jump in England, but merely a mid-sized escalation of affairs in Scotland.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the language of the Act precludes us from doing a distance reading or corpus analysis on this Act or the 1563 Scottish Witchcraft Act. Nevertheless, it is still important to acknowledge these Acts as foundational parts of Scottish witchcraft. In the coming sections, we will see if this act is followed in practice, just as Daemonologie should be followed in practice in Scottish witchcraft.</p>

                <h2>Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database</h2>
                <div align="left">
                    <p>Now that we have contextualized Scottish witchcraft through reference to Daemonologie and King James’ view of witchcraft as it led to legislation, we can look at actual cases of witchcraft in Scotland in the form of the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database. Beginning in 2001 and based at the University of Edinburgh, its goal was to “collect, collate and record all known information about accused witches and witchcraft belief [in Scotland] in a Microsoft Access database and to create a web-based user interface for the database” (“About the Project,” The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft). There is a web-based interface used for interacting with the database, which has been organized based on individual witches and cases with the available information regarding their accusations and trials. The database has been untouched since its completion in 2003, and so is hard to access and really engage with in some ways. It is my hope that this piece not only discovers information worthy of study for my own purposes, but that other scholars with an interest in this material might be inspired by this approach and do more critical work on this underused database and fascinating subject. </p>
                    <p>When the Microsoft Access database is unpacked and exported as more typical file formats, 38 individual tables make up the information in the database. Documentation for the database download says there are three levels to the organization of the database: “Accused,” which simply lists the accused, of which the database has 3,219 examples; “Case,” where the details of the case are relayed in the majority of the tables; and “Trial Process,” where the processes of the trial are discussed, with witnesses, applicable torture, and so on.</p> 
                <h3>Close Reading of Specific Tables</h3>
                    <p>By deconstructing the framework of the original database, we are able to analyze specific individual tables that were a part of it in order to look for interesting pieces for analysis. As stated earlier, the goal of analyzing these records on this closer level allowed for through deconstruction of the data is to see if there is obvious continuity between King James’ rhetoric around witchcraft and the practice of witchcraft prosecution in Scotland. </p>
                <h4>White Magic</h4>
                    <p>First, by looking at the table entitled WDB_WhiteMagic, we can clearly see that there was a culture of prosecuting white magic alongside other, more malicious kinds, though to a much lesser extent. 85 cases are listed where white magic use is known and qualified. The cases are as follows:</p>
                        <p><ul>
	                        <li>1 count of astrology</li>
	                        <li>2 counts of diagnosing bewitchment</li>
	                        <li>5 counts of divination</li>
	                        <li>10 counts of finding lost goods</li>
	                        <li>13 counts of “love magic”</li>
	                        <li>1 count of opening a lock</li>
	                        <li>30 counts of prophesy</li>
	                        <li>19 counts of protective magic</li>
	                        <li>3 counts of “second sight”</li>
	                        <li>1 count of acting as medium for spirits</li>
                        </ul></p>
                    <p>All of this is consistent with James’ understanding of witchcraft laid out in both Daemonologie and the 1608 Witchcraft Act. Indeed, in Chapter 5 of the first book, in response to Philomathes’ doubt that all magic is bad because some who do magic do good, Epistemon says that “for although, as none can be scholars in a school and not be subject to the master thereof, so none can study and put in practice (for the study alone, and knowledge, is more perilous than offensive; and it is the practice only that makes the greatness of the offence) the circles and art of magic, without committing a horrible defection from God” (81). Additionally, in the 1604 Witchcraft Act put forward by James, all types of witchcraft are banned and punishable, and simply attempting without success to cause harm through witchcraft is punishable by death. This is similar to the 1563 Scottish Witchcraft Act, where merely consulting with a witch is grounds for execution.</p>
                    <p>Next, we will turn our attention to the table entitled WBD_CounterStrategy. This table is important to analyze because it contradicts a crucial understanding of witchcraft held by James. When we examine this table for the kinds of counter-strategies used, we see that practice does not match up exactly with James' understanding of white magic. Indeed, out of the 78 cases listed in the database that utilized a counter strategy to perceived witchcraft, 23 of them used some kind of “white magic” in order to defend against a perceived influence witchcraft – 15 counts of counter-magic, 5, counts of protective magic, and 3 counts of consulting a community healer. Additionally, there is 1 count of seeking advice, which could be understood as similar to consulting a community healer with perceived knowledge of witchcraft. This shows there is a practice of countering witchcraft that is altogether contrary to James’ understanding and laws regarding witchcraft. This complicates our understanding of “white magic” as practiced in Scotland in periods of intense witch prosecution.</p>
                <h4>Witchcraft vs. Magic</h4>
                	<p>Another interesting element that emerges from a distance reading of certain tables in the database is the dichotomy between witchcraft and “magic” as done by necromancers and magicians. In Daemonologie, King James qualifies the difference between the two as essentially that witches are slaves to the devil, and magicians or necromancers are masters of the devil (68). This mastery of the devil is not through actual power but through an official pact, where the devil is bound to obey the magician but gains from him his body and soul in the end, which is his main goal. There is a clearly gendered divide between the two practices, as magicians are often considered to be learned men whose studies have led them to these dark arts. Additionally, this learning is not essentially evil, but King James says its practice is against God.</p>
			<p>All of this material regarding magicians leads us to believe that magic as practiced by learned men is not taken as seriously as witchcraft is, and that its understanding and, to a lesser extent, practice is less vilified. With this said, is there a reflection of this in the statistics laid out in the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft?</p>
			<p>To do this, we must analyze the table entitled WBD_OtherCharges, which lists the other charges the accused were presented with alongside witchcraft. When examining this, there is a small but strange overlap between what is considered witchcraft and what is considered magic. There is also a reflection in the statistics of that magic and magicians were not prosecuted as often, and that witchcraft was typically the main practice of the devil that was fought in law. While we must acknowledge that these statistics are biased in favour of witchcraft due to the nature of the database, recognizing that there are still charges of necromancy and magic laid is important. Below is a list of all the other charges laid alongside witchcraft: those that are deemed related to witchcraft are <b>bolded</b>, and those deemed related to magicians are <i>italicized</i>. Subsequently, we will take another look at these charges to see if any other patterns emerge. </p>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
<ul>
<li><b>Sorcery – 157</b></li>
<li><b>Charming – 136</b></li>
<li>Murder - 60</li>
<li><b>Enchantment - 36</b></li>
<li><i>Necromancy – 22</i></li>
<li>Consulting - 18</li>
<li>Poisoning - 12</li>
<li>Incantation - 11</li>
<li>Adultery - 6</li>
<li>Superstition - 5</li>
<li>Treason - 5</li>
<li>Cursing - 4</li>
<li>Incest - 4</li>
<li><b>Divination - 3</b></li>
<li>Invocation of Spirits - 3</li>
</ul>
				</div>
 				
 				<div class="col-sm-6"><ul><li>Bewitching - 1</li>
<li>Bigamy - 1</li>
<li>Blasphemy - 1</li>
<li>Child murder - 1</li>
<li>Fireraising - 1</li>
<li><i>Magic – 1</i></li>
<li><b>Prophesy - 1</b></li>

<li>Receiving stolen property - 2</li>
<li>Slander - 2</li>
<li>Sodomy - 2</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here it is clear what we should draw from this. The two largest charges levied against accused witches are charming and sorcery, two things associated with witches who have no great power. There are also several other charges that are smaller but still related to witchcraft, such as enchantment. Conversely, there are only 22 charges of necromancy and only one of simply “magic,” signifying the weighted nature of these charges against those seen as witches proper as opposed to simply practitioners of “dark arts.”</p>
                <h4>Northern Scotland - Map Analysis</h4>
                    <p>One last point of interest this analysis will deal with regards an assertion by King James regarding witchcraft and the invocation of spirits in northern Scotland. In response to Philomathes' question as to why so many spirits and witches could be found in the highlands of Scotland, such as in "Orkney and Shetland," Epistemon declares it is "because where the Devil finds greatest ignorance and barbarity, there assails he most grossly, as I gave you the reason wherefore there were more witches of womenkind than men" (165). Thus, this point of analysis will attempt to derive from some of the charts whether or not there is a higher amount of witchcraft in the north of Scotland than in the south.</p> 
                    <p>This is a map of locations of parishes of complaint. This means this is simply where complaints of witchcraft were lodged throughout Scotland over the time period the database covers. These complaints do not necessarily include names, so it is limited as actual analysis as they do not present actual accused witches but merely perceived experiences of witchcraft. Still, this map is effective as an indication of the spread of charges in Scotland.</p>
                    <div align="center">
                    <iframe width="600" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?q=select+col3+from+1nedYgd_JefgWJRm7mJi4nfuaW18LenssGWlaMCfJ&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=57.306559881457225&amp;lng=-4.542921708593781&amp;t=1&amp;z=7&amp;l=col3&amp;y=4&amp;tmplt=4&amp;hml=GEOCODABLE"></iframe></div><br><br>
                    <p>As we can see, the amount of complaints in the country is overwhelming, even more so considering many of these are unfounded initial complaints not referring to any specific person. Still, we can surmise that there are indeed a fair number of complaints in the far north of Scotland where Epistemon declares there are many cases of spirits and witches. This is compounded by the assumed lower population in the north, given the beginnings of urbanization in the south of the country where people would be beginning to move to. Whether these complaints in the north become full-on cases will be explored by the subsequent maps.</p>
                    <p>This map of confessions narrows down the cases of witchcraft to those where a confession was given. This was the prime mover in any witchcraft case, where a confession was sought after before any trial or serious search of the person begun. As one can see, there is a lower number of cases listed on this map.</p>
                    <div align="center">
                    <iframe width="600" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?q=select+col9+from+1R074Zz2uBzhhj8eAejaGeG8qMP0_HNoWCDnk1Ao9&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=56.61574451223109&amp;lng=-3.498986490625043&amp;t=1&amp;z=6&amp;l=col9&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=2&amp;hml=ONE_COL_LAT_LNG"></iframe><br><br>
                    </div>
                    <p>One can tell that, while there are still a great deal of confessions marked in the lower part of the map, especially surrounding Edinburgh, the Orkney Islands and Shetland islands have no confessions listed in them. This may be because of the limited scope of resources regarding those northern areas of Scotland, but it appears that, despite the many complaints made in the country towards witch activities, not all of them came to confessions or substantiated crimes. </p>
                    <p>Lastly, there is a map of the actual imprisonments of those deemed witches in Scotland. We understand, from the 1604 Act, that witches were typically hanged if they conspired to use their powers to harm or kill people, but that for smaller incidents of witchcraft, such as simple charms, or looking for gold and silver, or to heal someone using magic, one would be imprisoned for a year and pilloried 4 times in that year in a public place. Thus, while this statistic does not give us an indication of those who had committed more serious crimes and were executed, as their records were often not recorded, it does give us a hint at the pervasiveness of witchcraft in a certain area.</p>
                    <div align="center">
                    <iframe width="600" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?q=select+col8+from+1JRuB6JXYzRbLZEl7Ni80wziz_MqR2CIYAahXHkWY&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=57.307167063284965&amp;lng=-3.5441391651366985&amp;t=1&amp;z=6&amp;l=col8&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=2&amp;hml=ONE_COL_LAT_LNG"></iframe><br><br>
                    </div>
                    <p>From this map, we can see there are only two cases of imprisonment in the areas in question: one in Kirkwall, the other in Scalloway. These are not indicators of large scale witchcraft occuring in this area of the country, but other factors contribute to this. We can recognize that the population of southern Scotland must have been much higher due to the great density of population in the respective urban centers that were the center of social, economic and political activity at the time. This would naturally correlate to higher counts of witchcraft in a country that fervently believed in witches throughout the world at this time. The more northern parts of the country in question, conversely, were less stringently Calvinist due to language barriers and their relatively strong isolation. All of this complicates the issue of actual cases of witchcraft in the Orkneys and Shetlands, and whether or not King James was accurate in claiming there are more cases of spirits and witches there.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <div align="left">
                	<p>This project has attempted to draw some simple conclusions from a quantitative study of some sources of Scottish witchcraft. Both qualitative and quantitative data have been used, in the form of King James' Daemonologie and the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft. Analysis has revealed both new understandings of Scottish witchcraft that were initially unseen, and reinforced previously held notions about witchcraft. We have learned that there was still white magic used by authorities in opposition to witchcraft; we have seen there is a peculiar divide between witchcraft and "magic," represented in other charges levied against witches; and we have discussed the reality of more witchcraft in the north of Scotland based on mapping of data.</p>
                	<p>Some might say that these conclusions are simply a general representation of what is in the database and Daemonologie qualitatively, but I disagree. All of this has complicated our view of both Daemonologie and the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft by revealing new layers to analysis, which is important. I firmly believe that this kind of academic work, that seeks to read literature and data in novels ways, is essential, not only for making new discoveries, but for setting groundwork for other scholars to engage with this material in new ways that I have not and could not. Despite the limited nature of my conclusions, this analysis has been an excellent exercise in quantitative analysis and scholarship that will hopefully further the study of Scottish witchcraft in the years to come.</p>
