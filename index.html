                <h2>Daemonologie and the 1608??? Witchcraft Act</h2>
                <div align="left">
                <p>Daemonologie was written in 1597 by King James VI of Scotland and I of England as a treatise on the existence of witches in the world. This treatise was instrumental in the growth of Scottish witchcraft prosecution and thus must be analyzed in order to have any understanding of the Scottish Witchcraft database. It was partly inspired by James’ involvement in the trial of the North Berwick witches, who were eventually condemned for treasonous activities of trying to kill the king for the devil. As the witches said in court that the devil thought the king was the greatest enemy he had on Earth, James made it his lifelong duty, as a soldier of Christ, to fight witches and lead his nation against Satan (Tyson, 3-4). The treatise eventually led, when James was crowned king of England as James I, to the new 1604 act regarding witchcraft, which abolished Elizabeth’s 1563 act and placed much harsher punishments on the practice of witchcraft. Just attempting to cause harm using witchcraft, which was punishable by one year of imprisonment under the Elizabethan law, was now punishable by hanging. Any form of preparing or attempting to invoke witchcraft was made a felony punishable by hanging, including offences to property and livestock. It is the purpose of this distance reading and analysis to discover if there is indeed a connection between the witchcraft laid out in Daemonologie and the actual prosecution and persecution of those deemed witches in this period. </p>
            <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>First, we will turn to a brief close reading and summary of Daemonologie. The treatise is made up of three separate books in the form of a dialogue, each dealing with a different aspect of witchcraft. The dialogue is between two friends, Philomathes and Epistemon, the latter ostensibly representing King James himself. </p>
                <p>The first book deals with the existence of witchcraft and how it operates in the world between a witch and the devil. The dialogue discusses the differences between witches who practice sorcery and magicians who practice necromancers, based on both common misconceptions and their level of learning. Conversation moves towards a discussion of “white magic’s” existence and how it is just as bad as harmful magic because it still contravenes the teachings of the Bible. Necromancy, on the other hand, may be studied by learned men but its practice is unlawful as well, because to be a master of necromancy is to be commanded by the devil himself. The two then discuss what is constituted in a pact with the devil, alongside what the nature of fallen angels is. Epistemon holds that certain ideas about fallen angels being elemental are false because angels fell not according to weight but by their nature, and God would not permit their hierarchy to be known by humans. The book concludes by stating that magicians too should be condemned for practicing magic just as witches are, refuting ideas that they are good and that Moses was one under God. </p>
                <p>The second book moves to a discussion of the practices of witches. Philomathes raises three initial objections to the existence of witches, and Epistenom refutes them each in turn. First, in response to the assertion that the Bible only refers to magic in the context of magicians and not witches, “Epistemon agrees that many referred to in the Bible who used magic were necromancers and magicians, but asserts that others were witches, according to the vulgar definition of a witch being one controlled or ruled by the Devil” (Tyson 31). The second reason Philomathes gives is that witches do not actually have the power of the devil but are just afflicted with mental illness and melancholy. Epistemon argues that witches do not exhibit the typical symptons of melancholy as understood at that time. Finally, to the assertion that if witches did exist, mankind would fall to their power, Epistemon says that the power of the devil is limited by God himself, so witches therefore are also limited. Epistemon moves on to explain his definition of sorcery, along with different classifications of reasoning and practices. These are detailed and varied, often drawing upon the Scriptures but also on King James’ own beliefs and experiences regarding witchcraft. </p>
                <p>The final third book deals with the four types of spirits that exist and that may be employed by a witch. These four types are spirits that haunt houses and places, which have diverse names and may enter a house through the body of a dead person; spirits that haunt and follow people, which are some of the worst possible spirits to encounter; incubi and succubi, found in northern Scottish provinces more often due to lax moral standing, and are essentially sex spirits that possess the body of a person and cause problems for them; and fairies, which Epistemon asserts do not actually exist but are delusions of the devil or Catholic superstition. They then briefly discuss the proper methods of punishing a witch, and execution by fire is considered the best way to go about it. Also, legal practice regarding the prosecution of witches is discussed, with suggestions of caution to judges, methods of discovering objective proof of witchcraft in the form of marks, and the legitimacy of witches testifying against other witches. </p>
            <h4>Corpus Analysis</h4>
                <p>Initially, the modern English translation of all three books of Daemonologie were plugged into Voyant Tools’ basic text analyzer all as one file. Results from that were much more responsive than trying with the originally spelt version of the treatise, and findings were varied and somewhat surprising. Below is a wordcloud created from Daemonologie that, while not particularly useful in an academic setting, is still an effective visual tool for understanding the treatise at a quantitative level.</p> 
                <iframe style='width: 100%; height: 800px' src='http://voyant-tools.org:80/?stopList=keywords-7d360ab749d3f038025b9e44d09e6190&visible=25&view=Cirrus&corpus=f8577fad5ca3169ef64ae366e3f21950'></iframe>
                <p>The 6 most frequent terms in all three of the books were god (86), devil (50), spirits (48), things (39), spirit (37), and finally witches (36). It is surprising to see that witches was such a small number compared to other terms that one might expect to be secondary to them. Indeed, as the main point of this piece is to discuss the reality of witches, seeing them as much lower on the frequent word list is hard to understand. Witchcraft as a term, additionally, appeared 20 times in the corpus, adding to the number of references to the subject but still well below the number of times the term ‘god’ or terms relating to spirits appeared. My initial conclusion from seeing this is that the way King James discussed witchcraft fit with his Protestant worldview and conception of the actual power of witches. The language in his treatise reflects the assumption of witches being only allowed their limited power from God’s providence, and the same with the devil. By speaking about God and the devil more than actual witches, whom his treatise is ostensibly about, James reveals his Protestant beliefs that can be discovered both on a close reading level and from a distance. This conclusion serves as initial evidence at the value of quantitative analysis of this kind of text. </p>
                <p>Additionally, visualization of links between terms in the corpus allow for further understanding of larger concepts in the treatise. Below is an interactive graph showing links between terms.</p> 
                <iframe style='width: 100%; height: 800px' src='http://voyant-tools.org:80/?mode=corpus&stopList=keywords-7d360ab749d3f038025b9e44d09e6190&view=CollocatesGraph&corpus=f8577fad5ca3169ef64ae366e3f21950'></iframe>
                <p>We can draw several interesting conclusions from this that support our already solid understanding of James’ treatise. We can see that the strongest connections on the graph emanate from the term ‘god;’ the two strongest connections are towards ‘law’ and ‘permits,’ with weaker connections towards ‘devil,’ ‘knows,’ and ‘horrible.’ While I cannot initially contextualize why the latter is of note, the other connections all solidify our understanding that God is in full control of worldly affairs,  especially by the term ‘permits.’ </p>

                <h2>Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database</h2>
                <div align="left">
                    <p>Now that we have contextualized Scottish witchcraft through reference to Daemonologie and King James’ view of witchcraft as it led to legislation, we can look at actual cases of witchcraft in Scotland in the form of the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database. Beginning in 2001 and based at the University of Edinburgh, its goal was to “collect, collate and record all known information about accused witches and witchcraft belief [in Scotland] in a Microsoft Access database and to create a web-based user interface for the database” (“About the Project,” The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft). There is a web-based interface used for interacting with the database, which has been organized based on individual witches and cases with the available information regarding their accusations and trials. The database has been untouched since its completion in 2003, and so is hard to access and really engage with in some ways. It is my hope that this piece not only discovers information worthy of study for my own purposes, but that other scholars with an interest in this material might be inspired by this approach and do more critical work on this underused database and fascinating subject. </p>
                    <p>When the Microsoft Access database is unpacked and exported as more typical file formats, 38 individual tables make up the information in the database. Documentation for the database download says there are three levels to the organization of the database: “Accused,” which simply lists the accused, of which the database has 3,219 examples; “Case,” where the details of the case are relayed in the majority of the tables; and “Trial Process,” where the processes of the trial are discussed, with witnesses, applicable torture, and so on.</p> 
                <h3>Close Reading of Specific Tables</h3>
                    <p>By deconstructing the framework of the original database, we are able to analyze specific individual tables that were a part of it in order to look for interesting pieces for analysis. As stated earlier, the goal of analyzing these records on this closer level allowed for through deconstruction of the data is to see if there is obvious continuity between King James’ rhetoric around witchcraft and the practice of witchcraft prosecution in Scotland. </p>
                <h4>White Magic</h4>
                    <p>First, by looking at the table entitled WDB_WhiteMagic, we can clearly see that there was a culture of prosecuting white magic alongside other, more malicious kinds, though to a much lesser extent. 85 cases are listed where white magic use is known and qualified. The cases are as follows:</p>
                        <p><ol>
	                        <li>1 count of astrology</li>
	                        <li>2 counts of diagnosing bewitchment</li>
	                        <li>5 counts of divination</li>
	                        <li>10 counts of finding lost goods</li>
	                        <li>13 counts of “love magic”</li>
	                        <li>1 count of opening a lock</li>
	                        <li>30 counts of prophesy</li>
	                        <li>19 counts of protective magic</li>
	                        <li>3 counts of “second sight”</li>
	                        <li>1 count of acting as medium for spirits</li>
                        </ol></p>
                    <p>All of this is consistent with James’ understanding of witchcraft laid out in both Daemonologie and the 1608 Witchcraft Act. Indeed, in Chapter 5 of the first book, in response to Philomathes’ doubt that all magic is bad because some who do magic do good, Epistemon says that “for although, as none can be scholars in a school and not be subject to the master thereof, so none can study and put in practice (for the study alone, and knowledge, is more perilous than offensive; and it is the practice only that makes the greatness of the offence) the circles and art of magic, without committing a horrible defection from God” (81). Additionally, in the 1608 Witchcraft Act put forward by James – EXPOUND EXPOUND EXPOUND. </p>
                    <p>Next, we will turn our attention to the table entitled WBD_CounterStrategy. This table is important to analyze because it contradicts a crucial understanding of witchcraft held by James. When we examine this table for the kinds of counter-strategies used, we see that practice does not match up exactly with James' understanding of white magic. Indeed, out of the 78 cases listed in the database that utilized a counter strategy to perceived witchcraft, 23 of them used some kind of “white magic” in order to defend against a perceived influence witchcraft – 15 counts of counter-magic, 5, counts of protective magic, and 3 counts of consulting a community healer. Additionally, there is 1 count of seeking advice, which could be understood as similar to consulting a community healer with perceived knowledge of witchcraft. This shows there is a practice of countering witchcraft that is altogether contrary to James’ understanding and laws regarding witchcraft. This complicates our understanding of “white magic” as practiced in Scotland in periods of intense witch prosecution.</p>
                <h4>Witchcraft vs. Magic</h4>
                	<p>Another interesting element that emerges from a distance reading of certain tables in the database is the dichotomy between witchcraft and “magic” as done by necromancers and magicians. In Daemonologie, King James qualifies the difference between the two as essentially that witches are slaves to the devil, and magicians or necromancers are masters of the devil (68). This mastery of the devil is not through actual power but through an official pact, where the devil is bound to obey the magician but gains from him his body and soul in the end, which is his main goal. There is a clearly gendered divide between the two practices, as magicians are often considered to be learned men whose studies have led them to these dark arts. Additionally, this learning is not essentially evil, but King James says its practice is against God.</p>
			<p>All of this material regarding magicians leads us to believe that magic as practiced by learned men is not taken as seriously as witchcraft is, and that its understanding and, to a lesser extent, practice is less vilified. With this said, is there a reflection of this in the statistics laid out in the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft?</p>
			<p>To do this, we must analyze the table entitled WBD_OtherCharges, which lists the other charges the accused were presented with alongside witchcraft. When examining this, there is a small but strange overlap between what is considered witchcraft and what is considered magic. There is also a reflection in the statistics of that magic and magicians were not prosecuted as often, and that witchcraft was typically the main practice of the devil that was fought in law. While we must acknowledge that these statistics are biased in favour of witchcraft due to the nature of the database, recognizing that there are still charges of necromancy and magic laid is important. Below is a list of all the other charges laid alongside witchcraft: those that are deemed related to witchcraft are <b>bolded</b>, and those deemed related to magicians are <i>italicized</i>. Subsequently, we will take another look at these charges to see if any other patterns emerge. </p>
<p><ul>
<li><b>Sorcery – 157</b></li>
<li><b>Charming – 136</b></li>
<li>Murder - 60</li>
<li><b>Enchantment - 36</b></li>
<li><i>Necromancy – 22</i></li>
<li>Consulting - 18</li>
<li>Poisoning - 12</li>
<li>Incantation - 11</li>
<li>Adultery - 6</li>
<li>Superstition - 5</li>
<li>Treason - 5</li>
<li>Cursing - 4</li>
<li>Incest - 4</li>
<li><b>Divination - 3</b></li>
<li>Invocation of Spirits - 3</li>
<li>Theft - 3</li>
<li>Fornication - 2</li>
<li>Receiving stolen property - 2</li>
<li>Slander - 2</li>
<li>Sodomy - 2</li>
<li>Bewitching - 1</li>
<li>Bigamy - 1</li>
<li>Blasphemy - 1</li>
<li>Child murder - 1</li>
<li>Fireraising - 1</li>
<li><i>Magic – 1</i></li>
<li><b>Prophesy - 1</b></li>
<li>Rape - 1</li>
<li>Soothsaying - 1</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Here it is clear what we should draw from this. The two largest charges levied against accused witches are charming and sorcery, two things associated with witches who have no great power. There are also several other charges that are smaller but still related to witchcraft, such as enchantment. Conversely, there are only 22 charges of necromancy and only one of simply “magic,” signifying the weighted nature of these charges against those seen as witches proper as opposed to simply practitioners of “dark arts.”</p>
